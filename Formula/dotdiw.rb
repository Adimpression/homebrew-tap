  # Verified 2026-11-01 from this working copy, after the tag was moved to the
  # rebuilt main: the sha256 was computed from the downloaded tag tarball, brew fetched it against that sum, `brew test`
  # passed, the shebang was rewritten to the keg's python@3.12, and the keg's
  # dotdiw adopted a throwaway repository in bd's stealth mode on a fresh
  # HOME: no commit by bd, nothing of bd's tracked, nothing global written.
